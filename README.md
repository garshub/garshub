### Hi there üëã

I'm a passionate engineer obsessed with clean code, efficient logic, and scalable systems. I thrive in collaborative sprints, tackling complex challenges and breathing life into innovative ideas. My expertise lies in building backend infrastructure, API design, and systems architecture.

Languages/Frameworks/Tools: Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JavaScript, Node, Express, SQL, MongoDB, AWS.

Skills: Building blocks, not buzzwords: Communication, collaboration, problem-solving, critical thinking. Ô∏è

Beyond the code: Strategizing over chessboards, and constructing decks (both digital and physical). ‚ôüÔ∏è
